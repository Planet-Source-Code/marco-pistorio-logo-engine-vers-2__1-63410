This is an old project that i've realized on my great Commodore 64 more years ago.
Now i've ported all in VB.

The engine emulates the LOGO commands: Forward, Back, Left, Right, PenUp. PenDown.

With this version contains :
1) very simple management of colors.
2) very simple management of the zoom factor
3) a couple of commands to manage the direction and the position of the turtle
4) more samples that shows some classical curves.

Thanks to G. Callegarin - C. Salvagno for the algorithm of the samples 6,7,8.

Enjoy with this program and Tell me what do you think about,please. 
Bye.
